# Cadensio Documentation

Documentation website for Cadensio, a side project exploring SaaS development.

This repository contains the documentation website for Cadensio, an all-in-one management platform designed for bakeries, pastry shops, and cafés. The goal is to help artisans manage their online presence, production, orders, and daily operations in one place.

**Status:** Early-stage side project built as a learning experience. Currently working towards a functional MVP.

## Why This Exists

This project serves as a practical playground to learn full-stack SaaS architecture and build production-grade code. The primary focus is on learning by doing and shipping quality software.
